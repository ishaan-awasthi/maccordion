# Maccordion - turn your mac into an accordion! (kinda)

download the [latest release](https://github.com/ishaan-awasthi/maccordion/releases/tag/v1.0.0) to get started

### how to play

* hold your mac sideways/vertically in your lap
* aka hold it like an accordion, with the keyboard toward your right hand
* use your keyboard to select pitches
* _lightly_ push your screen to give it "air" and play the music

### keyboard layout
* treble (C-C): 1 to del

* minor chords (C-B): q to ]

* major chords (C-B): a to ret

* bass: (C-A#): z to rshift

### special keys
* tab: sustain/release any current notes

* caps lock: mute all keys

* esc: quit Maccordion :(

### tips:
* 1/q/a/z all play C, so the keyboard is pretty aligned!
* each minor chord is intuitively right behind its parallel major. for example, look at A (Cmaj) and Q (Cmin)
* stop pumping mid-note for fade-outs; in general, pump speed = volume
* you can play multiple notes simultaneously (this works best for bass/treble, not so much chords)
* A→K→P→H is a standard IV-vi-IV in C major, and a good place to start with Maccordion; try playing the chords with your thumb and a melody with your fingers!

## thank you, and happy playing!
